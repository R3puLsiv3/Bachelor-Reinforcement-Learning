This is the source code of my Bachelor thesis "Building Energy Management by Deep Reinforcement Learning".

Five Q-learning variations are applied to a simulated house environment which consists of solar panels, a battery and access to grid energy supply.

The five reinforcement learning agents are:
- Q-Learning
- DQN
- Double DQN
- Prioritized Experience Replay DQN
- Prioritized Experience Replay Double DQN

Code for prioritized experience replay DQN is adapted from https://github.com/Howuhh/prioritized_experience_replay
